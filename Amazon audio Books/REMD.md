Ever wanted to analyze the world of audiobooks on Audible? This project dives deep into [Audible.com](https://www.audible.com/search) and extracts audiobook data — from **titles and authors** to **ratings, prices, and more** — with a touch of automation magic using Python and Selenium.

### 🚀 What It Does
This script automatically:
- Navigates all search result pages on Audible
- Scrapes useful info like:
  - 📚 Title  
  - ✍️ Author  
  - ⏱ Runtime  
  - 💵 Price  
  - 🌍 Language  
  - 🗓 Release Date  
  - ⭐ Rating 
- Saves the results neatly into a CSV (`audible_books.csv`) for easy analysis

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Selenium** (for browser automation)  
- **Pandas** (for data storage and CSV export)

### 💡 Why I Built It
I created this project to level up my **web scraping** skills and learn how to interact with **dynamic websites** using Selenium. Audible’s rich, structured content made it a perfect real-world challenge.

### 👨‍🔧 My Contribution
I built this project from scratch — setting up the crawler, handling pagination, extracting data fields, and organizing everything into a clean and usable format.

### 📂 Output Example
The output is a well-structured CSV file containing detailed info about dozens (or hundreds!) of audiobooks.
